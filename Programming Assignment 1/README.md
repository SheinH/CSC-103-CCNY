Cho Han Bakuchi is a very simple betting game using two standard dice (read the link). Probably this short video script explains what it means. In this assignment, you will be playing with two other betters, player 1 and 2. The three of you, having the same starting allowance of $100, must bet (cannot pass the round) up to their maximum allowances. By winning, the same amount will be given by the house dealer. 

A slight intelligence you need to implement is: if the allowance of player 1 or 2, say player 1's, becomes less than yours, the betting of player 1will become up to the half of player 1's allowance so that player 1 can take an defensive position. When player 1 gains more than you, player 1's betting goes up to the maximum allowance again. Note that this rule applies to player 2 too.

The game will end if you become broke or other two players become broke.
